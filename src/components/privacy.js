CONTENT POLICY
InCampus is a free service for communication, self-expression and freedom of speech. We believe InCampus increases the availability of information, encourages healthy debate, and makes possible new connections between people. It is our belief that censoring this content is contrary to a service that bases itself on freedom of expression.
However, in order to uphold these values, we need to curb abuses that threaten our ability to provide this service and the freedom of expression it encourages. As a result, there are some boundaries on the type of content that can be hosted with InCampus. the boundaries we've defined are those that both comply with legal requirements and that serve to enhance the service as a whole. if you encounter a content that you believe violates our policies, please report it to us. if the content owner has hidden this link, you can still report.

CONTENT BOUNDARIES
our content policies play an important role in maintaining a positive experience for you, the users. please respect these guidelines. from time to time, we may change our content policies so please check back here. also, please note that when applying the policies below, we may make exceptions based on artistic, educational, documentary, or scientific considerations or where there are other substantial benefits to the public from not taking action on the content.

adult content:
We do not allow adult content on InCampus, including images or videos that contain nudity or sexual activity. we do not allow illegal sexual content, including image, video or textual content that depicts or encourages rape, incest, bestiality, or necrophilia. do not post or distribute private nude, sexually explicit, or non-explicit intimate and sexual images or videos without the subject’s consent. if someone has posted a private nude, sexually explicit, or non-explicit intimate and sexual image or video of you, please report it to us here.

child safety:
we have a zero-tolerance policy towards content that exploits children. some examples of this include:

child sexual abuse imagery:
e will terminate the accounts of any user we find publishing or distributing child sexual abuse imagery.

hate speech:
our products are platforms for free expression, but we don’t permit hate speech. hate speech is content that promotes or condones violence against or has the primary purpose of inciting hatred against an individual or group on the basis of their race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, age, nationality, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other characteristic that is associated with systemic discrimination or marginalization.

crude content:
don't post content just to be shocking or graphic. For example, collections of close-up images of gunshot wounds or accident scenes without additional context or commentary would violate this policy.

it's not okay to post violent or gory content that's primarily intended to be shocking, sensational, or gratuitous. if posting graphic content in a news, documentary, scientific, or artistic context, please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand what's going on. In some cases, content may be so violent or shocking that no amount of context will allow that content to remain on our platforms. Lastly, don't encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.

terrorist content:
We do not permit terrorist organizations to use InCampus for any purpose, including recruitment. InCampus also strictly prohibits content related to terrorism, such as content that promotes terrorist acts, incites violence, or celebrates terrorist attacks. if posting content related to terrorism for an educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic purpose, be mindful to provide enough information so viewers understand the context. graphic or controversial footage may be subject to age-restrictions or a warning screen.
